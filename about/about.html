    <h1>My journey</h1>

    <blockquote class = "blockquote text-center bg-light">
        <p>As a junior at Luther College, my learning to date suggests several things--that the future is global, the future is about creating a sustainable and healthy environment, and the future will be heavily dependent on data and technology. I am confident and prepared to enter this future. As a data science and computer science double major, and someone who also loves the liberal arts, I clearly understand the role technology plays in our lives and I enjoy the opportunity to use data to tell a story.</p> 
 
          <p> My story began in Bangladesh, the son of a lawyer and a teacher. I attended military school in Bangladesh for several years and discovered that it was not for me. I set off for Changshu, China to continue my education at an International Baccalaureate high school before making my way to northeast Iowa and Luther College. The world is, indeed, global. Along the way, I forged new friendships, came to better understand different countries, cultures, and contexts, and am living through encountered a life-defining global health pandemic. We are all shaped by our stories.
             
           <p>Through a variety of diverse work experiences, I have been able to apply and expand my technology skills in ways that align with my values. Through my work with the Executive Director of Admissions and Global Learning at Luther College, I have learned about the global education system and international admissions.  I have used my research and data-science skills extensively to make valuable contributions to the global admissions 4-year strategic plan, analyzing various datasets that are expected to play a role in the global economy and future demographics in different parts of the world. Working with Luther College’s Director of Institutional Research, I have quickly learned and applied evolving new technologies like  Hadoop and Business Intelligence tools. Modernizing Luther’s historical datasets and creating interactive dashboards has been energizing. </p> 
           <p>I have also applied my skills to the sustainable clothing industry, developed an automated online pricing system and worked as a social media analysis at The Getup, an upstart used clothing store, and performed research and data analytics at Dhakai.com, which connects sustainable clothing manufacturers from third world countries to retailers in first world countries, enabling sustainable fast-fashion with a lesser carbon footprint. I have also been inspired to found Norsebooks.com, and together with my team, have used fast development technologies to create a  modern website for peer to peer textbook resales for Luther College students. In just two months, we have developed a platform, have 70+ users with over 300 listed texts, and secured funding to maintain operations for the next 4 years. </p> 
             
        <p> The amount of data being generated in the world is constantly growing, giving people an opportunity to tell their stories and I inspire to be a part of this data revolution. </p>
           <p> I am eager to use my skills in the field of technology and innovation and contribute to an organization’s needs. I am interested in an internship where I can challenge myself, continue to learn, and innovate for the future. I would love to work with a creative team to solve problems and apply my knowledge in both programming and data science. When given a problem, my approach is to dig in and figure out a way to solve it; being a part and problem-solving with a team excites me. While I believe I can make valuable contributions to any size organization, startup environments have particular appeal because of their dedication to innovation and new ideas.  In the long term, I desire to innovate technology and products that are both globally important and have a positive environmental impact. </p>
